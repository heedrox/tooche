Current status: a prototype

# How to use it
If you want to prototype the game, you need 3 players:

- (1) the guide
- (2) the one who is guided
- (3) the one who looks at (2) to know if answers are right. 

This last one looks at player 2 while guessing, to know if answers are right.

Third player has the images of the first player at hand, so he / she can know if the answer is right.

If the second player is right, third player orders to go to next image.

If the second player is wrong, this player orders to restart the level.
